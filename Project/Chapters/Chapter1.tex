\section{Project Aim}

The aim of this project is to develop a system that allows more communication with outpatients in regards to their appointments, in an attempt to: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item reduce the amount of resources wasted in the event of no-shows and cancellations
  \item reducing the human cost that is required to manage appointments
  \item increase the user experience when making and managing an appointment
\end{itemize}

This project will not aim to implement any scheduling algorithms, but rather create a system that will support current algorithms and possibly shape future algorithms. For this project, I will use a preordained scenario to show off the different features of the system.

It will also not aim to replace the current scheduling system entirely, but act as an alternative to allow willing patients more direct control and easier access to information regarding their appointments.

\section{Objectives}

The objectives of this project is to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Collect relevant background data about the problem domain
  \item Identify requirements necessary to address the problem
  \item Design a server-client system that implements these requirements
  \item Prototype a Server that communicates directly with multiple patients and a predetermined scheduling algorithm
  \item Prototype a Client Application (Smart-phone Application) that allows patients to interface with the server
  \item Test the systems functionality based on usability and performance
  \item Evaluate the success of the system in regards to improving user satisfaction, reducing human management resources and reducing appointment wastage
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Minimum Requirements}

The minimum requirements of this project is to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A working prototype smart-phone application that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Connects to a prototype server
		\item Allows the user to view information on their scheduled medical appointments
		\item Gives the user information such as location and map instructions, doctor's name, any perquisite tasks the user must undertake prior to the appointment
		\item Reminds the user about the appointment
		\item Receives appointment updates from the server
	\end{itemize}
	\item A working prototype server application that:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Connects to multiple clients
			\item Interfaces with a dumb appointment scheduler
			\item Notifies clients of changes to the schedule
			\item Uses client information to optimise the scheduling process
			\item Offers cancelled appointments to other clients
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Extensions}

The possible extensions are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Design a website interface for the system
	\item Investigate and test security issues
	\item App gives location information and integrates with google maps
	\item Additional App or website to be used by doctors
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Deliverables}

The deliverables are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Server application
	\item Client application
	\item Report and evaluation results
\end{itemize}

\section{Relevance to Degree Modules}

This project uses knowledge and techniques gained in modules studied as part of my Computer Science degree. The most relevant modules are typically 'Software Systems Engineering', 'Distributed Systems', 'User Adaptive Systems' and 'Human Computer Interaction'.
